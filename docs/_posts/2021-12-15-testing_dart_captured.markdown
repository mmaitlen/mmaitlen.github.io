ok, here goes my first real coding post.  Think I could cover somethings I've learned about testing in the latest
Flutter project I'm working in.

This is another paragraph. How is it handled?


{% highlight dart linenos %}
return Scaffold(
  appBar: AppBar(
    title: const Text("MGMDev"),
  ),
  body: const Text(
    "Hello World",
    style: TextStyle(
      fontSize: 36,
      fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
    ),
  ),
);
{% endhighlight %}
