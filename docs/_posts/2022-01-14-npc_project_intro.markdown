![dice](/assets/images/dice01.jpg){: style="float: left; padding: 5px;"} Broadcasting to the world at large that I've embarked on a new software project.  It consists of an application (web based at the moment) that generates Non Player Characters (NPCs) for Table Top Role Playing Games (TTRPG), for example 5th Edition Dungeons and Dragons.  I've been a D&D hobbiest for most of my life and a software developer for just a bit shorter.  I've started a number of projects for TTRPGs, but haven't gotten one across the finish line...whatever that means.  But fingers crossed, rolling a nat 20, lucky rabbit foot in hand, 2022 WILL BE THE YEAR!

The application currently has two main components: a Dart library for the generation engine and a Flutter web app to enable the front end functionality. Ver0.0.1 has barebones functionality, I wanted to push code out to get the process moving forward.  

With this limited functionality the user can generate the name of a male/female human or dwarf NPC.  You are free to checkout the NPC Generator on my sandbox web site [z333k.com](https://www.z333k.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}, maybe by the time you read this post it'll be a fully functional application...fingers crossed.
